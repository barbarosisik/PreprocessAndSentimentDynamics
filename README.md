The Effect of Different Preprocessing Methods on Sentiment Analysis
In this research we conducted on SemEval-2017 Task 4, Subtask A, we sought answers to the question, ’How do different data pre-processing methods affect sentiment analysis?’ by working on the sentiment analysis datasets prepared for the SemEval-2017 Task 4 research. This study is like a time-traveling rewind to SemEval-2017 Task 4, but with a twist. We spiced things up by making multiple data preprocessings and compared their accuracy effects, took inspiration from Hugging Face, and followed Analytics Vidhya’s lead to add a sprinkle of magic to the whole model of ours.
Leave the raw data backstage; our focus is on the glammed-up version. Think of it as sentiment analysis getting a makeover. We broke it down, looked at it from every angle, and even threw in some model comparisons for good measure. The result? A front-row seat to the drama between data pre-processing and sentiment analysis in the lively Twitter universe.
Our findings aren’t just for academia. We’re talking practical insights that could fine-tune how we read sentiments in the digital age. From Twitter fans to industry pros relying on social media vibes, this research opens up new chapters in the evolving tale of natural language processing and social media sentiment and also understand which years were though and which ones were a fairy-tale!
